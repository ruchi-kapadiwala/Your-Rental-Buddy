# Your-Rental-Buddy

This project comprises designing and building a database to assist students in finding off-campus accommodations by bringing them into an existing network of students who are searching for roommates, subletting a spot, or planning to renew leases with new roommates based on student's predilections such as proximity to the university, transit connectivity, budget etc.

We will be developing an application which will provide students an access to the database which will have following features:

Creating a profile(Both Renter & Rentee)
To add/remove/update the spot(Renter)
To find a spot/roommate(Rentee)
Filtering preferences(Both Renter & Rentee)
